AVT is the native utility token in the Aventus Network. Its use case is similar to any Proof of Stake system. 
Validators (or transaction processors) stake the token to ensure they can be penalised if they behave fraudulently. 
Users (or transaction originators) buy the token and pay fees to the Validators for providing the processing service. 

Furthermore, AVT holders will be able to vote on governance of the Aventus Network once fully rolled out, to approve new updates to the platform or amend system parameters. 

The token has a total fixed, circulating supply of 10,000,000 AVT.
